This is a console project with a set of mathematical mini-games. All interaction is implemented through the console. The program shows a menu with a selection of mini-games.

To start, you need to write the number of the desired mini-game. The program will ask you to write your username. Next, a mathematical problem will be given. The answer must be written to the console. If you give three correct answers, you will be considered a winner. If there is an error, the program will show the correct answer.
